A friend asked me to write an article for Linux Magazine, so I did a brain dump of some projects I’m currently toying around with. Suddenly I realized where all of my free time is leaking.

Anyway, it seems like a nice introductory post.

### Web development

  - http://jquery.com/ 
    is a Java Script library featuring a very appealing API, high level that is.

  - http://haml-lang.com/ 
    saves me the trouble of the ugly angle brackets and cumbersome closing tags in HTML while leaving me in control of the output

  - http://sass-lang.com/ 
    a related project for CSS

  - http://mustache.github.com/ 
    Templates with little enough logic to not seduce me to write actual code in templates, but enough to not be annoying. Available for most programming languages you can think of during a drinking game. So I can use the same templates server side and client side. As a data source, I can feed it JSON. Twitter does that.



### GUIs/Webapps:

  - Google Refine
    http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/
    A wet dream come true.

  - http://freebase.com/
    all kinds of data, goes well with the former

  - Emacs Gnus
    Mutt annoyed me to the point where I gave Gnus another try. This time I somehow like it, despite the confusing configuration. Goes very well with [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com/articles/).


### Admin stuff

  - http://grml.org/
    THE emergency live CD. Great fun even on calm days.

  - http://mmonit.com/monit/ 
    Surprisingly docile and light weight system monitoring tool

  - http://etherboot.org/ 
    Down with sneakernet, long live network boot

  - iSCSI
    just this short of trying it out − why just boot of the network when you can run your whole OS from it?
    
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx
    the cool kids these days run a Russian web server
